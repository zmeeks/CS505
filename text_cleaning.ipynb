      "I went down to the Piraeus yesterday with Glaucon, the son of Ariston, to say a prayer to the goddess,1 and also because I wanted to see how they would manage the festival, since they were holding it for the first time. I thought the procession of the local residents was beautiful, but the show put on by the Thracians was no less so, in my view.   After we had said our prayer and watched the procession, we started back toward town Then Polemarchus, the son of Cephalus, saw us from a distance  as we were hurrying homeward, and told his slave boy to run and ask us to wait for him.

Polemarchus’ father, Cephalus, was also inside, and I thought he looked quite old. You see, I hadn’t seen him for some time.

On the contrary, we would come to you. But as it is,  you ought to come here more often. I want you to know, you see, that in my case at least, as the other pleasures the bodily ones wither away, my appetites for discussions and their pleasures grow stronger.4 So please do as I   ask  have your conversation with these young men, and stay here with us, as you would with your close friends and relatives.\n",

I think we should learn from them since they are like people who have traveled a road that we too will probably have to follow what the road is like, whether rough and difficult or smooth and easy. And I would be particularly glad to find out from you what you think about it, since you have reached the point in life the poets call old age’s   threshold.5 Is it a difficult time of life? What have you to report about it?\n",

      "  By Zeus, Socrates, I will tell you exactly what I think. You see, [392a] a number of us who are more or less the same age often get together, so as to preserve the old saying. 6 When they meet, the majority of our members lament, longing for the lost pleasures of their youth and reminiscing about sex, drinking parties, feasts, and the other things that go along with them.   They get irritated, as if they had been deprived of very great things, and had lived well then but are not living now. Some others, too, even moan about the abuse heaped on old people by their relatives, and for that reason  recite a litany of all the evils old age has caused them. But I don’t think they blame the real cause, Socrates. After all, if that were the cause, I too would have had the same experiences, at least as far as old age is concerned, and so would everyone else of my age. But as it is, I have met others in the past   who don’t feel that way in particular, the poet Sophocles. I was once present when he was asked by someone, “How are you as far as sex goes, Sophocles? Can you still make love to a woman?” “Quiet, man,” he replied,  “I am very glad to have escaped from all that, like a slave who has escaped from a deranged and savage master.” I thought at the time what he said was sensible, and I still do. You see, old age brings peace and freedom from all   such things. When the appetites cease to stress and importune us, everything Sophocles said comes to pass, and we escape from many insane masters. But in these matters, and in those concerning one’s relatives, the real  cause isn’t old age, Socrates, but the way people live. If they are orderly and contented, old age, too, is only moderately onerous; if they aren’t, both old age, Socrates, and youth are hard to bear.  \n",

      "I imagine when you say that, Cephalus, the masses7 do not accept it. On  the contrary, they think you bear old age more easily, not because of the way you live, but because you are wealthy. For the wealthy, they say, have many consolations.  \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  That’s true, they are not convinced. And there is something in EPHALUS their objection, though not as much as they think. Themistocles’ retort is relevant here. When someone from Seriphus insulted him by saying his high reputation was due to his city, not to himself, he replied that, had he been a Seriphian, he would not be famous; but nor would the other, had he been an Athenian. The same account applies to those who are not rich and find old age hard to bear  a good person would not easily bear old age   if it were coupled with poverty, but one who wasn’t good would not be at peace with himself even if he were wealthy.\n",

As a moneymaker  I am in between my grandfather and my father.You see, my grandfather and namesake inherited about the same amount of wealth as I possess and multiplied it many times. However, my father, Lysanias, diminished   that amount to even less than I have now. As for me, I am satisfied to leave my sons here no less, but a little more, than I inherited.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  The reason I asked is that you do not seem particularly to love  money. And those who have not made it themselves are usually like that. But those who have made it themselves love it twice as much as anyone else. For just as poets love their poems and fathers their children, so those who have made money take their money seriously both as something they   have made themselves and just as other people do because it is useful. This makes them difficult even to be with, since they are unwilling to praise anything except money.\n",

      "  What I have to say probably would not persuade the masses.  But you are well aware, Socrates, that when someone thinks his end is near, he becomes frightened and concerned about things he did not fear before. It is then that the stories told about Hades, that a person who has been unjust here must pay the penalty there stories he used to make fun of  twist his soul this way and that for fear they are true. And whether because of the weakness of old age, or because he is now closer to what happens in Hades and has a clearer view of it, or whatever it is, he is filled with foreboding and fear, and begins to calculate and consider whether he has been   unjust to anyone. If he finds many injustices in his life, he often even awakes from sleep in terror, as children do, and lives in anticipation of evils [331a] to come. But someone who knows he has not been unjust has sweet good hope as his constant companion a nurse to his old age, as Pindar says. For he puts it charmingly, Socrates, when he says that when someone lives a   just and pious life,\n",

Not cheating someone even unintentionally, not lying to him,  not owing a sacrifice to some god or money to a person, and as a result departing for that other place in fear the possession of wealth makes no small contribution to this. It has many other uses, too, but putting one   thing against the other, Socrates, I would say that for a man with any sense, that is how wealth is most useful.\n",

Or is it sometimes just to do these things, sometimes unjust? I mean this sort of thing, for example  everyone would surely   agree that if a man borrows weapons from a sane friend, and if he goes mad and asks for them back, the friend should not return them, and would not be just if he did.

Clearly, he does not mean what we said a moment ago namely, giving back to someone whatever he has lent to you, even if he is out of his mind when he asks for it.

      "You must consider it as follows, Socrates, or you will be the most naïve  of all  a just man must always get less than does an unjust one. First, in their contracts with one another, when a just man is partner to an unjust, you will never find, when the partnership ends, that the just one gets   more than the unjust, but less. Second, in matters relating to the city, when taxes are to be paid, a just man pays more on an equal amount of property, an unjust one less; but when the city is giving out refunds, a just man gets nothing while an unjust one makes a large profit. Finally, when each of them holds political office, a just person even if he is not penalized  in other ways finds that his private affairs deteriorate more because he has to neglect them, that he gains no advantage from the public purse because of his justice, and that he is hated by his relatives and acquaintances because he is unwilling to do them an unjust favor. The opposite is   true of an unjust man in every respect. I mean, of course, the person I described before  the man of great power who does better21 than everyone else. He is the one you should consider if you want to figure out how [344a] much more advantageous it is for the individual to be unjust than just. You will understand this most easily if you turn your thoughts to injustice of the most complete sort, the sort that makes those who do injustice happiest, and those who suffer it those who are unwilling to do injustice   most wretched. The sort I mean is tyranny, because it uses both covert means and force to appropriate the property of others whether it is sacred or secular, public or private not little by little, but all at once. If  someone commits a part of this sort of injustice and gets caught, he is punished and greatly reproached temple robbers,22 kidnappers, housebreakers, robbers, and thieves are what these partly unjust people are called when they commit those harms. When someone appropriates the   possessions of the citizens, on the other hand, and then kidnaps and enslaves the possessors as well, instead of these shameful names he is called  happy and blessed  not only by the citizens themselves, but even by all who learn that he has committed the whole of injustice.

You do not think a shepherd to the extent that he is a shepherd fattens sheep with the aim of doing what is best for them. But you think that, like a guest about to be entertained at a feast, his aim is to eat   well or to make a future sale as if he were a moneymaker rather than a shepherd. But of course, the only concern of the craft of shepherding is to  provide what is best for that with which it deals, since it itself is adequately provided with all it needs to be at its best, as we know, when it does not fall short in any way of being the craft of shepherding.

      "  Then, it is clear now, Thrasymachus, that no type of craft or rule provides what is beneficial for itself; but, as we have been saying for   some time, it provides and enjoins what is beneficial for its subject, and aims at what is advantageous for it the weaker, not the stronger. That is why I said just now, my dear Thrasymachus, that no one chooses to rule voluntarily and take other people’s troubles in hand and straighten them out, but each asks for wages. You see, anyone who is going to practice his [347a] type of craft well never does or enjoins what is best for himself at least not when he is acting as his craft prescribes but what is best for his subject. It   is because of this, it seems, that wages must be provided to a person if he is going to be willing to rule, whether they are in the form of money or honor or a penalty if he refuses. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  What do you mean, Socrates? I am familiar with the first two kinds of wages, but I do not understand what penalty you mean, or how you can call it a wage.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  Then you do not understand the sort of wages for which the best people rule, when they are willing to rule. Don’t you know that those   who love honor and those who love money are despised, and rightly so? \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  I do.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  Well, then, that is why good people won’t be willing to rule   for the sake of money or honor. You see, if they are paid wages openly for ruling, they will be called hirelings, and if they take them covertly as the fruits of their rule, they will be called thieves. On the other hand, they won’t rule for the sake of honor either, since they are not ambitious honor-lovers. So, if they are going to be willing to rule, some compulsion or punishment must be brought to bear on them that is probably why wanting to rule when one does not have to is thought to be shameful. Now, the greatest punishment for being unwilling to rule is being ruled by someone worse than oneself. And I think it is fear of that that makes good people rule when they do rule. They approach ruling, not as though they were   going to do something good or as though they were going to enjoy themselves in it, but as something necessary, since it cannot be entrusted to anyone better than or even as good as themselves. In a city of good men, if  it came into being, the citizens would fight in order not to rule, just as they now do in order to rule. There it would be quite clear that anyone who is really and truly a ruler does not naturally seek what is advantageous for himself, but what is so for his subject. As a result, anyone with any sense   would prefer to be benefited by another than to go to the trouble of benefiting him. So I cannot at all agree with Thrasymachus that justice is what is advantageous for the stronger. But we will look further into that another  time. What Thrasymachus is now saying that the life of an unjust person is better than that of a just one seems to be of far greater importance. Which life would you choose, Glaucon? And which of our views do you   think is closer to the truth?\n",

However, I, at any rate, do not want to consider the matter in such simple terms, Thrasymachus, but to look into it in some such way as this  would you say that a city may be unjust and try to enslave other cities  unjustly, and succeed at enslaving them,27 and hold them in subjection which it enslaved in the past?\n",

We have shown that just people are wiser and better and more capable of acting, while unjust ones are not even  able to act together. For whenever we speak of men who are unjust acting together to effectively achieve a common goal, what we say is not altogether true. They would never have been able to keep their hands off each other if they were completely unjust. But clearly there must have been some sort of justice in them that at least prevented them from doing injustice   among themselves at the same time as they were doing it to others. And it was this that enabled them to achieve what they did. When they started doing unjust things, they were only halfway corrupted by their injustice. For those who are wholly bad and completely unjust are also completely incapable of acting. All this I now see to be the truth, and not  what you first maintained. However, we must now examine the question, as we proposed to do before,28 of whether just people also live better and are happier than unjust ones. I think it is clear even now from what we   have said that this is so, but we must consider it further. After all, the argument concerns no ordinary topic, but the way we ought to live.\n",

      "  Come on, then, listen to what I have to say as well, and see whether you still have that problem. You see, I think Thrasymachus gave up  before he had to, as if he were a snake you had charmed. Yet, to my way of thinking, there was still no demonstration on either side. For I want to hear what justice and injustice are, and what power each has when it is just by itself in the soul. I want to leave out of account the rewards and the consequences   of each of them.\n",

That is why I am going to speak at length in praise of the unjust life  by doing so, I will be showing you the way I want to hear you denouncing injustice and praising justice.  But see whether you want me to do what I am saying or not.\n",

      "  Excellent sentiments. Now, listen to what I said I was going to discuss first what justice is like and what its origins are. People say, you  see, that to do injustice is naturally good and to suffer injustice bad. But the badness of suffering it far exceeds the goodness of doing it. Hence, those who have done and suffered injustice and who have tasted both the ones   who lack the power to do it and avoid suffering it decide that it is profitable to come to an agreement with each other neither to do injustice nor [359a] to suffer it. As a result, they begin to make laws and covenants; and what the law commands, they call lawful and just. That, they say, is the origin and very being1 of justice. It is in between the best and the worst. The best   is to do injustice without paying the penalty; the worst is to suffer it without being able to take revenge. Justice is in the middle between these two extremes. People love it, not because it is a good thing, but because they are too weak to do injustice with impunity. Someone who has the power to do  it, however someone who is a real man would not make an agreement with anyone, neither to do injustice nor to suffer it. For him, that would be insanity. That is the nature of justice, according to the argument, Socrates,   and those are its natural origins.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We can see most clearly that those who practice it do so unwillingly, because they lack the power to do injustice, if we imagine the following  thought-experiment. Suppose we grant to the just and the unjust person the freedom to do whatever they like. We can then follow both of them and see where their appetites would lead. And we will catch the just person red-handed, traveling the same road as the unjust one. The reason for this is the desire to do better2 than others. This is what every natural being naturally   pursues as good. But by law and force, it is made to deviate from this path and honor equality.\n",
      "\n",
      "They would especially have the freedom I am talking about if they had  the power that the ancestor of Gyges of Lydia is said to have possessed.3 The story goes that he was a shepherd in the service of the ruler of Lydia. There was a violent thunderstorm, and an earthquake broke open the ground and created a chasm at the place where he was tending his sheep. Seeing this, he   was filled with amazement and went down into it. And there, in addition to many other amazing things of which we are told stories, he saw a hollow, bronze horse. There were windowlike openings in it and, peeping in, he saw a corpse, which seemed to be of more than human size, wearing nothing  but a gold ring on its finger. He took off the ring and came out of the chasm. He wore the ring at the usual monthly meeting of shepherds that reported to the king on the state of the flocks. And as he was sitting among   the others, he happened to turn the setting of the ring toward himself, toward the inside of his hand. When he did this, he became invisible to [360a] those sitting near him, and they went on talking as if he had gone. He was amazed at this and, fingering the ring, he turned the setting outward again and became visible. So, he experimented with the ring to test whether it   indeed had this power and it did. If he turned the setting inward, he became invisible; if he turned it outward, he became visible again. As soon as he realized this, he arranged to become one of the messengers sent to  report to the king. On arriving there, he seduced the king’s wife, attacked the king with her help, killed him, and in this way took over the kingdom.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let’s suppose, then, that there were two such rings, one worn by the just person, the other by the unjust. Now no one, it seems, would be so   incorruptible that he would stay on the path of justice, or bring himself to keep away from other people’s possessions and not touch them, when he could take whatever he wanted from the marketplace with impunity, go into people’s houses and have sex with anyone he wished, kill or release from prison anyone he wished, and do all the other things that would  make him like a god among humans. And in so behaving, he would do no differently than the unjust person, but both would pursue the same course.\n",
      "\n",
      "This, some would say, is strong evidence that no one is just willingly, but   only when compelled. No one believes justice to be a good thing when it is kept private, since whenever either person thinks he can do injustice with impunity, he does it. Indeed, all men believe that injustice is far more profitable to themselves than is justice. And what they believe is true, so the  exponent of this argument will say. For someone who did not want to do injustice, given this sort of opportunity, and who did not touch other people’s property, would be thought most wretched and most foolish by everyone aware of the situation. Though, of course, they would praise him in   public, deceiving each other for fear of suffering injustice. So much for my second topic.\n",
      "\n",
      "As for decision itself about the life of the two we are discussing, if we  contrast the extremes of justice and injustice, we shall be able to make the decision correctly; but if we don’t, we won’t. What, then, is the contrast I have in mind? It is this  we will subtract nothing from the injustice of the unjust person, and nothing from the justice of the just one. On the contrary, we will take each to be perfect in his own pursuit. First, then, let the   unjust person act like a clever craftsman. An eminent ship’s captain or doctor, for example, knows the difference between what his craft can and cannot do. He attempts the first but lets the second go by. And if he happens to [361a] slip, he can put things right. In the same way, if he is to be completely unjust, let the unjust person correctly attempt unjust acts and remain undetected. The one who is caught should be thought inept. For the extreme of injustice is to be believed to be just without actually being so. And our   completely unjust person must be given complete injustice nothing must be subtracted from it. We must allow that, while doing the greatest injustice, he has nonetheless provided himself with the greatest reputation for justice. If he does happen to slip up, he must be able to put it right, either  through his ability to speak persuasively if any of his unjust activities are discovered, or to use force if force is needed, because he is courageous and strong and has provided himself with wealth and friends.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Having hypothesized such a person, let’s now put the just man next to him in our argument someone who is simple and noble and who, as Aeschylus says, does not want to be believed to be good, but to be so.4 We must take away his reputation. For a reputation for justice would bring him honor and rewards, so that it would not be clear whether he is being just for the sake of justice, or for the sake of those honors and rewards. We must strip him of everything except justice, and make his situation the opposite of the unjust person’s. Though he does no injustice, he must have the greatest   reputation for it, so that he may be tested with regard to justice by seeing whether or not he can withstand a bad reputation and its consequences. Let him stay like that, unchanged, until he is dead just, but all his life  believed to be unjust. In this way, both will reach the extremes, the one of justice and the other of injustice, and we will be able to judge which of them is happier.\n",

      "  I am doing the best I can. Since the two are as I have described, in any case, it should not be difficult to complete the account of the sort of life that awaits each of them, but it must be done. And if what I  say sounds crude, Socrates, remember that it is not I who speak, but those who praise injustice at the expense of justice. They will say that the just person in such circumstances will be whipped, stretched on a rack, chained, blinded with a red-hot iron, and, at the end, when he has suffered every [362a] sort of bad thing, he will be impaled, and will realize then that one should not want to be just, but to be believed to be just. Indeed, Aeschylus’ words are far more correctly applied to the unjust man. For people will say that it is really the unjust person who does not want to be believed to be unjust,   but actually to be so, because he bases his practice on the truth about things and does not allow reputation to regulate his life. He is the one who “harvests  a deep furrow in his mind, where wise counsels propagate.” First, he rules his city because of his reputation for justice. Next, he marries into any family he wishes, gives his children in marriage to anyone he wishes, has contracts and partnerships with anyone he wants, and, besides benefiting himself in all these ways, he profits because he has no scruples about doing   injustice. In any contest, public or private, he is the winner and does better than his enemies. And by doing better than them, he becomes wealthy,  benefits his friends, and harms his enemies. He makes adequate sacrifices to the gods and sets up magnificent offerings to them, and takes much better care of the gods and, indeed, of the human beings he favors than the just person. So he may reasonably expect that the gods, in turn, will love   him more than the just person. That is why they say, Socrates, that gods and humans provide a better life for the unjust person than for the just one.\n",

      "That, then, is the praise and blame given to each. But in addition,   Socrates, there is another kind of argument about justice and injustice for you to consider one that is used both by private individuals and by poets. [364a] With one voice they all chant the hymn that justice and temperance are fine things, but difficult and onerous, while intemperance and injustice are sweet and easy to acquire and are only shameful by repute and convention. They also say that unjust deeds are, for the most part, more profitable than   just ones; and whereas they are perfectly willing to bestow public and private honors on bad people provided they have wealth and other types of power and to declare them to be happy, they dishonor and disregard those who happen to be in any way weak or poor, even though they admit that  they are better than the others.\n",

I mean those who are naturally gifted and able to flit, so to speak, from one of these sayings to another and gather from them an impression of what sort of people they should be, and of how best to travel the road of life. He  would surely ask himself Pindar’s question  “Is it by justice or by crooked tricks that I will scale the higher wall,” and so live out my life surrounded by secure defenses? And he will answer  “As for what people say, they say that there is no advantage in my being just if I am not also thought just,   whereas the troubles and penalties of being just are apparent; but the unjust person, who has secured for himself a reputation for justice, lives the life of a god. Since, then, ‘opinion forcibly overcomes truth,’ and ‘controls happiness,’ as the wise men say, I must surely turn entirely to it.10 I  should create an illusionist painting11 of virtue around me to deceive those who come near, but keep behind it the wise Archilochus’ greedy and cunning fox.”  \n",

And there are teachers of persuasion to make us clever in dealing with assemblies and law courts. Therefore, partly by persuasion, partly by force, we will   contrive to do better than other people, without paying the penalty.\n",

On the other hand, if they do exist, and do care about us, we know nothing about them  except what we have learned from the laws and from the poets who give their genealogies. But these are the very people who tell us that the gods can be persuaded and influenced by sacrifices, gentle prayers, and offerings. Hence, we should believe them on both matters, or on neither. If we   believe them, we should be unjust and offer sacrifices from the fruits of our [366a] injustice. For if we are just, our only gain is not to be punished by the gods, but we will lose the profits of our injustice. But if we are unjust, we will get those profits, and afterward we will entreat the gods and, persuading them, escape with our crimes and transgressions unpunished.\n",

      "On the basis of what further argument, then, should we choose justice over the greatest injustice? For if we possess such injustice with a false   façade, we will do as we have a mind to among gods and humans, both while we are living and when we are dead, as both the masses and the eminent claim. So given all that has been said, Socrates, what device could get  someone with any power whether of mind, wealth, body, or family to be willing to honor justice, and not laugh aloud when he hears it praised?\n",

      "Indeed, if anyone can show that what we have said is false, and has adequate   knowledge that justice is best, what he feels for unjust people won’t be anger, but a large measure of forgiveness. After all, he knows that apart from someone of godlike character who is disgusted by doing injustice, or someone who has gained knowledge and avoids injustice for that reason, no  one is just willingly. Through cowardice or old age or some other weakness, people do indeed object to injustice. But it is obvious that they do so only because they lack the power to do injustice. For the first of them to gain that power is the first to do as much injustice as he can.\n",
      "\n",
      "  And all this has no other cause than the one that led to the whole of Glaucon’s and my argument with you, Socrates. “Socrates, you amazing  man,” we said, “of all of you who claim to praise justice, beginning from the earliest heroes of old whose accounts survive up to the men of the present day, not one has ever blamed injustice or praised justice except by mentioning the reputations, honors, and rewards that are their consequences. No one has ever adequately described what each does itself,   through its own power, by its presence in the soul of the person who possesses it, even if it remains hidden from gods and humans. No one, whether in poetry or in private discussions, has adequately argued that injustice is the greatest evil a soul can have in it, and justice the greatest good. If all of you had spoken in this way and had tried to persuade us [367a] from our earliest youth, we would not now be guarding against one another’s injustice, but each would be his own best guardian, afraid that by doing injustice he would be living on intimate terms with the worst thing possible.”\n",

But I for I have no reason to hide anything from you want to hear the opposite from you,  and that is why I am speaking with all the force I can muster. So do not merely demonstrate to us by argument that justice is stronger than injustice, but tell us what each one itself does, because of itself, to someone who possesses it, that makes the one bad and the other good. Follow   Glaucon’s advice and do not take reputations into account.12 For if you do not deprive justice and injustice of their true reputations and attach false ones to them, we will say that it is not justice you are praising, but its reputation; nor injustice you are condemning, but its reputation; and that you are encouraging us to be unjust but keep it secret. In that case, we will say  that you agree with Thrasymachus that justice is the good of another, the advantage of the stronger, while injustice is one’s own advantage and profit, though not the advantage of the weaker.\n",

This is what I want you to praise about justice. How does it because of its very self benefit its possessor, and how does injustice harm him? Leave wages and reputations for others to praise.\n",

      "I can put up with other people praising justice and blaming injustice in   that way extolling the reputations and wages of the one and denigrating those of the other. But I won’t put up with that from you (unless you insist on it). For you have spent your whole life investigating this and nothing else. So do not merely demonstrate to us by argument that justice is stronger  than injustice, but show what effect each one itself has, because of itself, on the person who has it the one for good, the other for bad whether it remains hidden from gods and human beings or not.  \n",

They will recline on couches strewn with yew and myrtles and feast with their children,   drink their wine, and, crowned with wreaths, hymn the gods.

And there will have to be craftsmen of multifarious devices, including, among other things, those needed for the adornment of women. In particular, then, we  will need more servants don’t you think such as tutors, wet nurses, nannies, beauticians, barbers, and relish cooks and meat cooks, too? Moreover, we will also need people to farm pigs. This animal did not exist in our earlier   city, since there was no need for it, but we will need it in this one.

But isn’t it of the greatest importance that warfare be carried out well? Or is fighting a war so easy that a farmer, a shoemaker, or any other artisan can be a soldier at the same time, even   though no one can become so much as a good checkers player or dice player if he considers it only as a sideline and does not practice it from childhood? Can someone just pick up a shield, or any other weapon or instrument of war and immediately become a competent fighter in an  infantry battle or whatever other sort of battle it may be, even though no other tool makes someone who picks it up a craftsman or an athlete, or is even of any service to him unless he has acquired knowledge of it and has   had sufficient practice?\n",

After all, those stories are not true either. Still less should battles between  gods and giants, or the many other multifarious hostilities of gods and heroes toward their families and friends, occur in the stories the guardians hear or in the embroidered pictures they see. On the contrary, if we are   somehow going to persuade our people that no citizen has ever hated another, and that it is impious to do so, then those are the things their male and female elders should tell them from childhood on. And the poets they  listen to as they grow older should be compelled to tell them the same sort of thing. Stories about Hera being chained by her son, on the other hand, or about Hephaestus being hurled from heaven by his father when he tried to save his mother from a beating, or about the battle of the gods in Homer, should not be admitted into our city, either as allegories or non-allegories.   For the young cannot distinguish what is allegorical from what is not. And the beliefs they absorb at that age are difficult to erase and tend to become unalterable.

Nor will we allow the young to [380a] hear the words of Aeschylus  “A god makes mortals guilty, when he wants to destroy a house utterly.”25 And if anyone composes a poem, such as the   one those lines are from, about the sufferings of Niobe, or about the house of Pelops, or the tale of Troy, or anything else of that sort, he should be required to say that these things are not the works of a god. Or, if they are the works of a god, then the poet must look for roughly the sort of account of them we are now seeking  he must say that the actions of the gods are good and just, and that the people they punish are benefited by them. We  won’t allow him to say that those who are punished are made wretched, and that it was a god who made them so; but we will allow him to say that bad people are wretched because they are in need of punishment, and that in paying the penalty they are benefited by that god. But as for saying that a   god, who is himself good, is the cause of evils, we will fight that in every way. We won’t allow anyone to say it in his own city, if it is to be well governed, or anyone to hear it either whether young or old, whether with meter or without meter.

It would have gone something like this I will speak without meter since I am not a poet  the priest came and prayed that the gods would grant it to the Achaeans to capture Troy and have  a safe return home, and he entreated them to accept the ransom and free his daughter, out of reverence for the god.39 When he had said this, the others approved of it and consented. But Agamemnon was angry and ordered him to leave and never return, or else his priestly wand and the wreaths of the   god would not protect him. He said that the priest’s daughter would grow old in Argos by his side sooner than be freed. He ordered Chryses to leave and not make him angry if he wanted to get home safely. When the old man heard this, he was frightened and went off in silence. And once he had left [394a] the camp, he prayed at length to Apollo, invoking the cult names of the god, reminding him of his past gifts, and asking to be repaid for any that had found favor with him, whether they were temples he had built or victims he had sacrificed. He prayed that, in return for these things, the arrows of the   god would make the Achaeans pay for his tears. That, comrade, is how we get pure narration without any imitation. \n",

First, because rhythm and harmony permeate the innermost element of the soul, affect it more powerfully than anything else, and bring it grace, such education makes one graceful if one is properly trained,  and the opposite if one is not. Second, because anyone who has been properly trained will quickly notice if something has been omitted from a thing, or if that thing has not been well crafted or well grown. And so, since he feels distaste correctly, he will praise fine things, be pleased by them, take   them into his soul, and, through being nourished by them, become fine [402a] and good. What is ugly or shameful, on the other hand, he will correctly condemn and hate while he is still young, before he is able to grasp the reason.

After all, they do not treat a body with a body. If they did, we would not allow their bodies to be or become bad. But it is with a soul that a body is treated, and it   is not possible for a soul to treat anything well if it is or has become bad itself.\n",

And it is [409a] not possible for a soul to be nurtured among bad souls from childhood, to have associated with them, and to have itself indulged in every sort of injustice, so as to be able to draw exact inferences from itself about the injustices of others, as in the case of diseases of the body. On the contrary, it itself the craft of medicine, they associated withmust have no experience of, and be uncontaminated by, bad characters while it is young, if as a fine and good soul itself, it is going to make judgments about what is just in a healthy way. That is precisely the reason, indeed, that good people are thought to be naïve when they are young and easily deceived by unjust ones  they do not have models within themselves  of the behavior of bad ones.\n",

He must have trained himself over many years to discern how naturally bad it is by using his theoretical knowledge, not his own intimate experience of it. \n",

The clever and suspicious person, on the other hand, who has committed many injustices himself and thinks of himself to be unscrupulous and wise, appears clever when he associates with those like   himself, because he is on his guard and looks to the models within himself. But when he meets with good people who are older, he is seen to be stupid, distrustful at the wrong time, and ignorant of what a healthy character is, since he has no model of this within himself. But because he meets bad  people more often than good ones, he seems more wise than foolish, both to himself and to them as well.\n",

Therefore, the first and most important command from the god to the rulers is that there is nothing they must guard better or   watch more carefully than the mixture of metals in the souls of their offspring. If an offspring of theirs is born with a mixture of iron or bronze, they must not pity him in any way, but assign him an honor appropriate to  his nature and drive him out to join the craftsmen or the farmers. On the other hand, if an offspring of the latter is found to have a mixture of gold or silver, they will honor him and take him up to join the guardians or the   auxiliaries. For there is an oracle that the city will be ruined if it ever has an iron or a bronze guardian.” So, have you a device that will make them believe this story?\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  No, none that would make this group believe it themselves. But I do have one for their sons, for later generations, and for all other people who come after them.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  Well, even that would have a good effect, by making them care more for the city and for each other. For I think I understand what   you mean namely, that all this will go where tradition leads. What we can do, however, when we have armed our earthborn people, is lead them forth with their rulers at their head. They must go and look for the best place in the city for a military encampment, a site from which they can  most easily control anyone in the city who is unwilling to obey the laws, or repel any outside enemy who, like a wolf, attacks the fold. And when they have established their camp and sacrificed to the appropriate gods, they must make their sleeping quarters, mustn’t they?\n",

First, none of them should possess any private property that is not wholly necessary. Second, none should have living quarters or storerooms   that are not open for all to enter at will. Such provisions as are required by temperate and courageous men, who are warrior-athletes, they should receive from the other citizens as a salary for their guardianship, the  amount being fixed so that there is neither a shortfall nor a surplus at the end of the year. They should have common messes to go to, and should live together like soldiers in a camp. We will tell them that they have gold and   silver of a divine sort in their souls as a permanent gift from the gods, and have no need of human gold in addition. And we will add that it is impious for them to defile this divine possession by possessing an admixture of mortal gold, because many impious deeds have been done for the sake of the [417a] currency of the masses, whereas their sort is pure. No, they alone among the city’s population are forbidden by divine law to handle or even touch gold and silver. They must not be under the same roof as these metals, wear them as jewelry, or drink from gold or silver goblets. And by behaving in   that way, they would save both themselves and the city. But if they acquire private land, houses, and money themselves, they will be household managers and farmers instead of guardians hostile masters of the other citizens,  instead of their allies. They will spend their whole lives hating and being hated, plotting and being plotted against, much more afraid of internal than of external enemies already rushing, in fact, to the brink of their   own destruction and that of the rest of the city as well. For all these reasons, let’s declare that that is how the guardians must be provided with housing and the rest, and establish it as a law. Or don’t you agree?\n",

Others own land, build fine, big houses,   acquire furnishings to go along with them, make their own private sacrifices to the gods, entertain guests, and also, of course, possess what you were talking about just now  gold and silver and all the things that those who are going to be blessedly happy are thought to require.

However, in establishing our   city, we are not looking to make any one group in it outstandingly happy, but to make the whole city so as far as possible. For we thought that we would be most likely to find justice in such a city, and injustice, by contrast, in the one that is governed worst. And we thought that by observing both cities, we would be able to decide the question we have been inquiring into for so long. At the moment, then, we take ourselves to be forming a happy  city not separating off a few happy people and putting them in it, but making the city as a whole happy.

We would think it reasonable to offer the following defense  “My amazing fellow,  you must not expect us to paint the eyes so beautifully that they no longer look like eyes at all, nor the other parts either. On the contrary, you must look to see whether, by dealing with each part appropriately, we are making the whole thing beautiful. Similarly, in the present case, you must not force us to give our guardians the sort of happiness that would make  them something other than guardians.You see, we know how to clothe the farmers in purple robes, festoon them with gold jewelry, and tell them to work the land whenever they please. We know we could have our potters recline on couches from right to left in front of the fire,3 drinking and   feasting with their wheel beside them for whenever they have a desire to make pots. And we can make all the others happy in the same way, so that the whole city is happy. But please do not urge us to do this. For if we are persuaded by you, a farmer won’t be a farmer, nor a potter a potter, nor [421a] will any of the others from which a city is constituted remain true to type. But for most of the others, it matters less  cobblers who become inferior and corrupt, and claim to be what they are not, do nothing terrible to the   city. But if the guardians of our laws and city are not really what they seem to be, you may be sure that they will destroy the city utterly and, on the other hand, that they alone have the opportunity to govern it well and make it happy.”\n",

What we have to consider, then, is whether our aim in   establishing the guardians is the greatest possible happiness for them, or whether since our aim is to see this happiness develop for the whole  city we should compel or persuade the auxiliaries and guardians to ensure that they, and all the others as well, are the best possible craftsmen at their own work; and then, with the whole city developing and being governed   well, leave it to nature to provide each group with its share of happiness.\n",

We should not praise such a claim, however, or take it to be what the poet meant. You see, a change to a new kind of musical training is something to beware of as wholly dangerous.

For the moment,   however, let’s complete the inquiry in which we supposed that if we first tried to observe justice in some larger thing that possessed it, that would make it easier to see what it is like in an individual human being.19 We agreed that this larger thing is a city, and so we founded the best city we  could, knowing well that justice would of course be present in one that was good. So, let’s apply what has come to light for us there to an individual, and if it is confirmed, all will be well. But if something different is found in the case of the individual, we will go back to the city and test it there. And   perhaps by examining them side by side and rubbing them together like fire-sticks, we can make justice blaze forth and, once it has come to light, [435a] confirm it in our own case.\n",

He binds together all of these and, from  having been many, becomes entirely one, temperate and harmonious.

In all these areas, he considers and calls just and fine the action that preserves this inner harmony   and helps achieve it,28 and wisdom the knowledge that oversees such action; and he considers and calls unjust any action that destroys this harmony, and ignorance the belief that oversees it.29 [444a]\n",

Similarly, he will call their children his grandchildren, and they, in turn, will call the group to which he belongs grandfathers and grandmothers. And those who were born at the same time as their mothers and fathers were breeding, they will call their brothers and  sisters.

Neither the physical condition of athletes nor that of one who is overly reliant on medical treatment and poorly suited to exertion is useful from the point of view of health or procreation, or is the condition needed in a good citizen. But the condition that is in a mean between these two is useful for these purposes. The proper physical condition, therefore, is one that is achieved by exertion, but not by violent exertion, and that promotes not just one thing, as the athletic condition does, but the actions of free people.

Like the unskilled, who are trapped by the clever checkers players in the end and  cannot make a move, they too are trapped in the end, and have nothing to say in this different kind of checkers, which is played not with pieces, but with words. Yet they are not a bit more inclined to think that what you claim is true. I say this in relation to the present case.

      "Imagine, then, that the following sort of thing happens either on one ship or on many. The shipowner is taller and stronger than everyone else on board. But he is hard of hearing, he is a bit shortsighted, and his  knowledge of seafaring is correspondingly deficient. The sailors are quarreling with one another about captaincy.8 Each of them thinks that he should captain the ship, even though he has not yet learned the craft and cannot name his teacher or a time when he was learning it. Indeed, they   go further and claim that it cannot be taught at all, and are even ready to cut to pieces anyone who says it can. They are always crowding around the shipowner himself, pleading with him, and doing everything possible to  get him to turn the rudder over to them. And sometimes, if they fail to persuade him and others succeed, they execute those others or throw them overboard. Then, having disabled their noble shipowner with mandragora9 or drink or in some other way, they rule the ship, use up its cargo   drinking and feasting, and make the sort of voyage you would expect of such people. In addition, they praise anyone who is clever at persuading or forcing the shipowner to let them rule, calling him a “sailor,” a “skilled captain,” and “an expert about ships” while dismissing anyone else as a    good-for-nothing. They do not understand that a true captain must pay attention to the seasons of the year, the sky, the stars, the winds, and all that pertains to his craft if he is really going to be expert at ruling a ship. As for how he is going to become captain of the ship, whether people want him  to or not, they do not think it possible to acquire the craft or practice of doing this at the same time as the craft of captaincy. When that is what is happening onboard ships, don’t you think that a true captain would be sure [489a] to be called a “stargazer,” a “useless babbler,” and a “good-for-nothing” by those who sail in ships so governed?\n",

The man who came up with that bit of sophistry was lying.10 What is truly natural is for the sick person, rich or poor, to go  to doctors’ doors, and for anyone who needs to be ruled to go to the doors of the one who can rule him. It is not for the ruler if he is truly any use to beg the subjects to accept his rule.

Having learned all this through associating and spending time17 with the beast, he calls this wisdom, gathers   his information together as if it were a craft, and starts to teach it.

Only the god knows whether it is true. But this is how these phenomena seem to me  in the knowable realm, the last thing to be seen is the form of the good, and it is seen only with toil and trouble. Once one has seen it, however, one must infer that it is the cause of all that is correct and beautiful  in anything, that in the visible realm it produces both light and its source, and that in the intelligible realm it controls and provides truth and understanding; and that anyone who is to act sensibly in private or public must see it.  \n",

If he kept in mind that the same applies to the soul, then when he saw a soul disturbed and unable to see something, he would not   laugh absurdly. Instead, he would see whether it had come from a brighter life and was dimmed through not having yet become accustomed to the dark, or from greater ignorance into greater light and was dazzled by the increased brilliance.

After all, they have  grown there spontaneously, against the will of the constitution in each of them.

But both for your own sakes and for that of the rest of   the city, we have bred you to be leaders and kings in the hive, so to speak. You are better and more completely educated than the others, and better  able to share in both types of life.5 So each of you in turn must go down to live in the common dwelling place of the other citizens and grow accustomed to seeing in the dark. For when you are used to it, you will see infinitely better than the people there and know precisely what each image is, and also what it is an image of, because you have seen the truth about fine,   just, and good things. So the city will be awake, governed by us and by you; not dreaming like the majority of cities nowadays, governed by men who fight against one another over shadows and form factions in order to rule  as if that were a great good.6 No, the truth of the matter is surely this  a city in which those who are going to rule are least eager to rule is necessarily best and freest from faction, whereas a city with the opposite kind of rulers is governed in the opposite way.”\n",

If anyone tries to learn something about perceptible things, whether by gaping upward or squinting downward, I would say that he never really learns since there is no knowledge to be had of such things and that his soul is not looking up but  down, whether he does his learning lying on his back on land or on sea!\n",

As for the rest, we described them as to some extent grasping what is I mean, geometry and the subjects that follow it. For we saw that while they do dream about what is, they cannot see it while wide awake as long as they make use of hypotheses  that they leave undisturbed, and for which they cannot give any account.

These cycles are short for what is short-lived and the opposite for what is the opposite.

      "10 The human geometrical number is the product of 3, 4, and 5 “thrice increased”   if (3 × 4 × 5) × (3 × 4 × 5) = (3 × 4 × 5)2 is one increase, (3 × 4 × 5) × (3 × 4 × 5) × (3 × 4 × 5) × (3 × 4 × 5) = (3 × 4 × 5)4 is three. This formula included “increases involving both roots and powers”  (3 × 4 × 5) is a root; its indices are powers. It “comprehends” three “intervals,” symbolized by ×, and four “terms” namely, the roots. The resulting number, 12,960,000, can be represented geometrically as  (1) a square whose sides are 3,600, or (2) an “oblong” or rectangle whose sides are 4,800 and 2,700. (1) is “so many times 100”  36 times. (2) is obtained as follows. The “rational diameter” of 5 is the nearest rational number to the real diameter of a square whose sides are 5. This diameter = √52 + 52 = √50 = 7. Since the square of 7 is 49, we get the longer side of the rectangle by diminishing 49 by 1 and multiplying the result by 100. This gives 4,800. The “irrational diameter” of 5 is √50. When squared (= 50), diminished by 2 (= 48), and multiplied by 100, this, too, is 4,800. The short side, “100 cubes of three,” = 2,700. The significance of the number is more controversial. The factors “that cause likeness and unlikeness, cause increase and decrease, and make all things mutually agreeable and rational in their relations to one another” are probably the numbers, since odd numbers were thought to cause likeness and even ones unlikeness (Aristotle, Physics203a13–5). Of the numbers significant in human life, one is surely the 100 years of its maximum span (615a8–b1). Another might be the number of days in the year (roughly 360), and a third might be the divisions of those days into smaller units determined by the sun’s place in the sky, since it is the sun that provides for “the coming-to-be, growth, and nourishment” of all visible things (509b2–4). Assuming that those units are the 360 degrees of the sun’s path around the earth (a suggestion due to Robin Waterfield), the number of moments in a human life that have a potential effect on its coming-to-be, growth, and nourishment would be 100 × 360 × 360, or 12,960,000 Plato’s human geometrical number.\n",

Hence, if a one-unit square represents the degree of closeness to true pleasure of an image nine times removed from it, true pleasure should be represented by a nine-unit cube. It follows that the king lives 729 times more pleasantly than the tyrant. However, in order to reach the significant number 729 there are 729 days and nights in a year of 364 twenty-four– hour days and 729 months in the “great year” recognized by the Pythagorean philosopher Philolaus Socrates has had to make two rather fast moves. First, he illegitimately capitalizes on the Greek manner of counting series in order to count the oligarch twice, once as the last term in his first series (tyrant, democrat, oligarch) and again as the first term in his second series (oligarch, timocrat, king). Second, he multiplies the number of times the tyrant is removed from the oligarch by the number of times the oligarch is removed from the king, when he should have added them. In fact, the tyrant is only five times removed from the king, and so lives only 125 times less pleasantly!\n",

He has  been deceived, it seems, by an encounter with some sort of sorcerer or imitator, whom he therefore considers to be all-wise.

They claim, you see, that if a good poet is to write beautiful poetry about the things he writes about, he must have knowledge of them when he   writes, or else he would be unable to. We should consider, then, whether those who tell us this have been deceived by their encounters with these imitators and do not realize, when they see their works, that they are three [599a] removes from what is, and are easy to produce without knowledge of the truth. For they produce illusions, not things that are.

And let’s not ask them about the other crafts either, but leave them aside. When it comes, however, to the greatest and most beautiful things of which Homer undertakes to speak warfare, generalship, city government, and a person’s education surely, it is fair to question him as follows  “My dear Homer, if you  are not third removed from the truth about virtue, and are not the sort of craftsman of an image, which is what we defined an imitator to be, but if you are even in second place and capable of knowing what practices make   people better or worse in private or in public life, tell us which cities are better governed because of you, as the Lacedaemonians are because of Lycurgus, and as many others great and small are because of many other  men. What city gives you credit for having proved to be a good lawgiver who benefited it? Italy and Sicily give it to Charondas, and we give it to Solon.

Protagoras of Abdera, Prodicus   of Ceos, and a great many others are able to convince anyone who associates with them in private that he wouldn’t be able to manage his household or city unless they themselves supervised his education, and they are so  intensely loved because of this wisdom of theirs that their disciples do everything except carry them around on their shoulders. Are we to believe, then, that if Homer had been able to help people become virtuous, his   companions would have allowed either him or Hesiod to wander around as rhapsodes, and wouldn’t have clung far tighter to them than to gold and compelled them to come home and live with them?

That is how great a natural spell these things cast. For if a poet’s works are stripped of their musical colorings and spoken just by themselves, I think you know what they look like.

On the contrary, it thinks that to be a clear profit I mean the pleasure it gets. And it would not want to be deprived of it by despising the whole poem.

But what it is like in truth, seen as it should be, not maimed by its partnership with the body and other bad  things, which is how we see it now, what it is like when it has become pure that we can adequately see only by means of rational calculation. And you will find it to be a much more beautiful thing than we thought and get a much clearer view of all the cases of justice and injustice and of all   the other things that we have so far discussed. So far, what we have said about the soul is true of it as it appears at present. But the condition we  have seen it in is like that of all the sea god Glaucus,14 whose original nature cannot easily be made out by those who catch glimpses of him, because some of the original parts of his body have been broken off, others have been worn away and altogether mutilated by the waves, and other things shells, seaweeds, and rocks have grown into him, so that he looks more   like any wild beast than what he naturally was. Such, too, is the condition of the soul when we see it beset by myriad bad things. But, Glaucon, we should be looking in another direction.\n",

      "  Well, it is not an Alcinous-story I am going to tell you, but that of a brave man called Er, the son of Armenias, by race a Pamphylian.25 Once upon a time, he was killed in battle. On the tenth day, when the rest   of the dead were picked up, they were already putrefying, but he was picked up still quite sound. When he had been taken home and was lying on the pyre before his funeral on the twelfth day, he revived and, after reviving, told what he had seen in the other world.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "He said that when his soul had departed, it traveled together with many  others and came to a daimonic26 place, where there were two adjacent openings in the earth and two in the heavens above and opposite them. Judges were seated between these. And, when they had made their judgments,   they told the just to go to the right up through the heavens, with signs of the judgments attached to their fronts. But the unjust they told to travel to the left and down. And they too had on their backs signs of all  their deeds. When he himself came forward, they said that he was to be a messenger to human beings to tell them about the things happening there, and they told him to listen to and look at everything in the place.\n",
      "\n",
      "Through one of the openings in the heavens and one in the earth, he saw souls departing after judgment had been passed on them. Through the other   two, they were arriving. From the one in the earth they came up parched and dusty, while from the one in the heavens they came down pure. And the  ones that had just arrived seemed to have come from a long journey, and went off gladly to the meadow, like a crowd going to a festival, and set up camp there. Those that knew one another exchanged greetings and those coming up from the earth asked the others about the things up there, while those from the heavens asked about the others’ experiences. They told their [615a] stories to one another, the former weeping and lamenting as they recollected all they had suffered and seen on their journey below the earth which lasted a thousand years and the ones from heaven telling, in turn, about their happy experiences and the inconceivably beautiful sights they had seen.\n",
      "\n",
      "  To tell it all, Glaucon, would take a long time. But the gist, he said, was this  for all the unjust things they had done and for all the people they had wronged, they had paid the penalty for every one in turn, ten times over for each. That is to say, they paid for each injustice once in every hundred years of their journey, so that, on the assumption that a hundred years is  roughly the length of a human life, they paid a tenfold penalty for each injustice. For example, if some of them had caused many deaths or had betrayed cities or armies and reduced them to slavery, or had taken part in   other evildoing, they would receive ten times the pain for each of them. On the other hand, if they had done good deeds and become just and pious, they received commensurate awards.\n",
      "\n",
      "He said some other things about the stillborn and those who lived for  only a short time, but they are not worth recounting. And he told of even greater wages for impiety or piety toward gods or parents, and for murder. He said he was there, you see, when someone asked where the great Ardiaius  was. This Ardiaius had been a tyrant in a city in Pamphylia just a thousand years before that, and was said to have killed his aged father and older brother and committed many other impious deeds as well. He said the one  who was asked responded  “He has not come here and never will. For in fact this, too, was one of the terrible sights we saw. When we were near the mouth, about to come up after all our sufferings were over, we suddenly   saw Ardiaius together with some others, almost all of whom were tyrants although there were also some private individuals among them who had committed great crimes. They thought that they were about to go up, but  the mouth would not let them through. Instead, it roared whenever one of these incurably bad people, or anyone else who had not paid a sufficient penalty, tried to go up. At that location, there were savage men, all fiery to look at, standing by, paying attention to the sound, who grabbed some of these people and led them away. But in the case of Ardiaius and others, they bound their feet, hands, and neck and threw them down and flayed them. [616a] They dragged them along the road outside, lacerating them on thorn bushes. They explained to those who were passing by at the time why they were being dragged away, and said that they were to be thrown into Tartarus. He said that of the many and multifarious fears they experienced there, the greatest each of them had was that the sound would be heard as   he came up, and that each was very pleased when it was silent as he went up. Such then were the penalties and punishments, and the rewards that were their counterparts. \n",
      "\n",
      "When each group had spent seven days in the meadow, on the eighth they had to move on from there and continue their journey. In four days, they came to a place where they could see stretching from above, through the whole heaven and earth, a straight beam of light, like a column, very closely resembling a rainbow, but brighter and more pure. They reached   the beam after traveling another day’s journey. And there, in the middle of the light, they saw stretching from the heavens the ends of its bonds for  this light is what binds the heavens, like the cables underneath a trireme, thus holding the entire revolving thing together. From those ends hangs the spindle of Necessity, by means of which all the revolving things are turned.   Its shaft and hook were adamant, while its whorl27 was adamant mixed with materials of other kinds. The nature of the whorl was as follows. Its shape was like the ones here on Earth, but from Er’s description, we must think  of it as being like this  in one great whorl, hollow and scooped out, lay another just like it, only smaller, that fitted into it exactly, the way nested bowls fit together; and similarly a third and a fourth, and four others. For   there were eight whorls altogether, lying inside one another, with their rims appearing as circles from above, while from the back they formed one  continuous whorl around the shaft, which is driven right through the center of the eighth.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, the first or outermost whorl had the broadest circular rim, that of   the sixth was second, third was that of the fourth, fourth that of the eighth, fifth that of the seventh, sixth that of the fifth, seventh that of the third, and eighth that of the second. That of the greatest was spangled; that of the seventh was brightest; that of the eighth took its color from the seventh’s shining [617a] on it; that of the second and fifth were very similar to one another, being yellower than the rest; the third was the whitest in color; the fourth was reddish; and the sixth was second in whiteness.\n",
      "\n",
      "  The spindle as a whole revolved at the same speed, but within the revolving whole the seven inner circles gently revolved in the opposite direction to the whole. Of these, the eighth moved fastest; second, and at  the same speed as one another, were the seventh, sixth, and fifth; third, it seemed to them, in the speed of its counter-revolution, was the fourth; fourth was the third; and fifth the second.28\n",
      "\n",
      "The spindle revolved on the lap of Necessity. On top of each of its circles   stood a Siren, who was carried around by its rotation, emitting a single sound, one single note. And from all eight in concord, a single harmony was produced. And there were three other women seated around it equidistant  from one another, each on a throne. They were the daughters of Necessity, the Fates, dressed in white with garlands on their heads Lachesis, Clotho, and Atropos and they sang to the accompaniment of the Sirens’ harmony, Lachesis singing of the past, Clotho of the present,   and Atropos of the future. Clotho, using her right hand, touched the outer circumference of the spindle and helped it turn, pausing from time to time; Atropos, with her left, did the same to the inner ones; and Lachesis used each hand in turn to touch both. \n",
      "\n",
      "When the souls arrived, they had to go straight to Lachesis. A sort of spokesman29 first arranged them in ranks; then, taking lots and models of lives from the lap of Lachesis, he mounted a high platform, and said   \n",
      "\n",
      "“The word of Lachesis, maiden daughter of Necessity! Ephemeral souls. The beginning of another death-bringing cycle for mortal-kind! Your daimon will not be assigned to you by lot; you will choose him. The one who has the  first lot will be the first to choose a life to which he will be bound by necessity. Virtue has no master  as he honors or dishonors it, so shall each of you have more or less of it. Responsibility lies with the chooser; the god is blameless.”  \n",
      "\n",
      "After saying that, the spokesman threw the lots out among them all, and each picked up the one that fell next to him except for Er, who was not allowed. And to the one who picked it up, it was clear what number he had drawn. After that again the spokesman placed the models of lives on the [618a] ground before them many more of them than those who were present. They were multifarious  all animal lives were there, as well as all human lives. There were tyrannies among them, some life-long, others ending halfway through in poverty, exile, and beggary. There were lives of famous   men some famous for the beauty of their appearance or for their other strengths or athletic prowess, others for their nobility and the virtues of their ancestors, and also some infamous in these respects and similarly for  women. But the structure of the soul was not included, because with the choice of a different life it would inevitably become different. But all the other qualities were mixed with each other and with wealth or poverty, sickness or health, or the states in between.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Here, it seems, my dear Glaucon, a human being faces the greatest danger of all, and because of that each must, to the neglect of all other subjects, take care above all else to be a seeker and student of that subject which will  enable him to learn and discover who will give him the ability and the knowledge to distinguish a good life from a bad, so that he will always and in any circumstances choose the better one from among those that are possible. He must calculate the effect of all the things we have mentioned just   now, both jointly and severally, on the virtue of a life, so as to know what the good and bad effects of beauty are when it is mixed with wealth or poverty and this or that state of the soul; what the effects are of high and  low birth, private lives and ruling offices, physical strength and weaknesses, ease and difficulties in learning, and all the things that are either naturally part of the soul or can be acquired by it, when they are mixed with one another. On the basis of all that he will be able, by considering the nature   of the soul, to reason out which life is better and which worse and choose  accordingly, calling worse the one that will lead the soul to become more unjust, and better the one that leads it to become more just. Everything else he will ignore. For we have seen that this is the best way to choose, whether in life or death.\n",
      "\n",
      "Holding this belief with adamantine determination, he must go down to [619a] Hades, so that even there he won’t be dazzled30 by wealth and other such evils, and won’t rush into tyrannies or other similar practices and so commit irreparable evils, and suffer even greater ones; but instead will know to   choose the middle life in such circumstances, and avoid either of the extremes, both in this life, so far as is possible, and in the whole of the life  to come. For this is how a human being becomes happiest.\n",
      "\n",
      "At that point our messenger from the other world also reported that the spokesman said this  “Even for the one who comes last, if he chooses wisely and lives earnestly, there is a satisfactory life available, not a bad one. Let not   the first to choose be careless, nor the last discouraged.”\n",
      "\n",
      "When the spokesman had told them that, Er said, the one who drew the first lot came up and immediately chose the greatest tyranny. In his foolishness and greed, you see, he chose it without adequately examining everything, and did not notice that it involved being fated to eat his own  children, among other evils. When he examined the life at leisure, however, he beat his breast and bemoaned his choice, ignoring the warning of the spokesman. For he did not blame himself for these evils, but chance, daimons,  and everything except himself. He was one of those who had come down from heaven, having lived his previous life in an orderly constitution,31 sharing in virtue through habit but without philosophy.\n",
      "\n",
      " Generally speaking, not the least number of the people caught out in this way were souls who came from heaven, and so were untrained in sufferings. The majority of those from the earth, on the other hand, because they had suffered themselves and had seen others doing so, were in no rush   to make their choices. Because of that, and also because of the chance of the lottery, there was an exchange of evils and goods for most of the souls. Yet, if a person, whenever he came to the life that is here, always practiced philosophy in a sound manner, and if the fall of the lot did not put his  choice of life among the last, it is likely, from what was reported by Er about the next world, that not only will he be happy here, but also that his journey from here to there and back again will not be underground and   rough,32 but smooth and through the heavens.\n",
      "\n",
      "He said it was a sight worth seeing how the various souls chose their lives, since seeing it caused pity, ridicule, and surprise. For the most part, [620a] their choice reflected the character of their former life. He saw the soul that had once belonged to Orpheus, he said, choosing a swan’s life  he hated the female sex because of his death at their hands, and so was unwilling to be   conceived in a woman and born.33 He saw the soul of Thamyris choosing a nightingale’s life, a swan changing to the choice of a human life, and other musical animals doing the same. The twentieth soul chose the life of a lion.  It was that of Ajax, son of Telamon, who avoided human life because he remembered the judgment about the armor.34 The next was that of Agamemnon, which also hated the human race on account of what it suffered, and so changed to the life of an eagle. Allotted a place in the middle,   the soul of Atalanta, when it saw the great honors of a male athlete, unable to pass them by, chose his life. After her, he saw the soul of Epeius, son of Panopeus, taking on the nature of a craftswoman. Further on, among the  last, he saw the soul of the ridiculous Thersites clothing itself as an ape.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now it chanced that Odysseus’ soul drew the last lot of all, and came to make its choice. Remembering its former sufferings, it rejected love of honor, and went around for a long time looking for the life of a private   individual who did his own work, and with difficulty it found one lying off somewhere neglected by the others. When it saw it, it said that it would have done the same even if it had drawn the first-place lot, and chose it  gladly. Similarly, souls went from the other animals into human beings, or into one another; the unjust changing into savage animals, the just into tame ones; and every sort of mixture occurred.  \n",
      "\n",
      "When all the souls had chosen lives, in the same allotted order they went forward to Lachesis. She assigned to each the daimon it had chosen, as guardian of its life and fulfiller of its choices. This daimon first led the soul  under the hand of Clotho as it turned the revolving spindle, thus ratifying the allotted fate it had chosen. After receiving her touch, he led the soul to the spinning of Atropos, to make the spun fate irreversible. Then, without   turning around, it went under the throne of Necessity. When it had passed through that, and when the others had also passed through, they all traveled [621a] to the plain of Lethe, through burning and choking and terrible heat, for it was empty of trees and earthly vegetation. They camped, since evening was coming on, beside the river of forgetfulness, whose water no vessel can   hold. All of them had to drink a certain measure of this water. But those not saved by wisdom drank more than the measure. And as each of them drank, he forgot everything. When they were asleep and midnight came,  there was a clap of thunder and an earthquake, and they were suddenly carried away from there, this way and that, up to their births, like shooting stars. But Er himself was prevented from drinking the water. Yet how or   where he had come back to his body, he did not know, but suddenly recovering his sight he now saw himself lying on the pyre at dawn.\n",
      "\n",
      "And so, Glaucon, his story was saved and not lost; and it would save us, too,  if we were persuaded by it, since we would safely cross the river Lethe with our souls undefiled. But if we are persuaded by me, we will believe that the soul is immortal and able to endure every evil and also every good, and   always hold to the upward path, practicing justice with wisdom every way we can, so that we will be friends to ourselves and to the gods, both while we remain here on Earth and when we receive the rewards of justice, and go around like victors in the games collecting prizes; and so both in this life and on the thousand-year journey we have described, we will fare well.\n"

      "this, that the doctrine of causality begins with an unnecessary\n",
      "duplication of all that happens. Language, and its origin among a\n",
      "people uneducated in thoughts and concepts, is at the root of this\n",

      "that the motive is always a \"struggle for existence\" presupposes the\n",

      "stock, and in that way enhance the value of life for that stock,\n",
      "they contradict higher men's values, and, by so doing, destroy their\n",

      "is within him, cannot look out upon life without transfiguring it,\n",
      "hallowing it, blessing it, and making it appear better, bigger, and\n",

      "An to what art means to the artist himself, apart from its actual\n",

      "contemporaries and the future; it is in this valuing that his impulse\n",
      "to prevail finds its highest expression. Hence the instinctive economy\n",
      "of artists in sex mattersthat is to say, in precisely that quarter\n",
      "whither other men go when their impulse to prevail urges them to\n",
      "action. Nietzsche did not of course deny the sensual nature of artists\n",
      "(Aph. 815); all he wished to make plain was this, that an artist who\n",

      "In the Fourth Book Nietzsche is really at his very best. Here, while\n",

      "in his exclusive sphere, that practically every line, even if it were\n",
      "isolated and taken bodily from the context, would bear the unmistakable\n",
      "character of its author. The thought expressed in Aphorism 871 reveals\n",
      "a standpoint as new as it is necessary. So used have we become to the\n",
      "practice of writing and legislating for a mass, that we have forgotten\n",
      "the rule that prevails even in our own navythat the speed of a fleet\n",
      "is measured by its slowest vessel.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the same principle, seeing that all our philosophies and moralities\n",
      "have hitherto been directed at a mass and at a mob, we find that their\n",
      "elevation must of necessity be decided by the lowest of mankind. Thus\n",
      "all passions are banned, because base men do not know how to enlist\n",
      "them in their service. Men who are masters of themselves and of others,\n",
      "men who understand the management and privilege of passion, become the\n",
      "most despised of creatures in such systems of thought, because they are\n",

      "in 912, 916, 943, and 951 we have plans of a constructive teaching\n",

      "how much has lain, and how much still lies, in man's power By laying\n",
      "his finger on everything and declaring to man that it was human will\n",
      "that created it. Nietzsche wished to give man the courage of this will,\n",
      "and a clean conscience in exercising it. For it was precisely this very\n",

      "all his valuations and all his most sublime inspirations to something\n",
      "outside himself,whether this something were a God, a principle, or\n",

      "all too human, have been the values that have appeared heretofore;\n",
      "he wished to prove, that to the rare sculptors of values, the world,\n",
      "despite its past, is still an open field of yielding clay, and in\n",
      "pointing to what the will to power has done until now, Nietzsche\n",
      "suggests to these coming sculptors what might still be done, provided\n",
      "they fear nothing, and have that innocence and that profound faith in\n",
      "the fundamental will which others hitherto have had in God, Natural\n",
      "Laws, Truth, and other euphemistic fictions.\n",

      "importance that it may be regarded almost as the inspiration which led\n",
      "to his great work, _Thus Spake Zarathustra,_ ought to be understood\n",
      "in the light of a purely disciplinary and chastening creed. In one of\n",
      "his posthumous works we find Nietzsche saying: \"The question which\n",

      "such a deed as I am prepared to perform an incalculable number of\n",
      "times,is the best ballast.\" Thus it is obvious that, feeling the need\n",
      "of something in his teaching which would replace the metaphysics of\n",
